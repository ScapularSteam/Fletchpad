## Tools and Languages used

**App:** Kotlin/Java (unknown at this time), Material You, Android Studio

**ML:** Python, Tensorflow Lite, Visual Studio Code


## FAQ

#### What platforms will be supported at launch?

At launch, only Android will be supported. This is due to the additional complexities faced with developing for IOS devices, coupled with the fact that I do not own devices for testing purposes.

#### What are the minimum requirements?

At this time, the minimum requirements will consist of a device running Android 11 or newer. 

This version has been chosen to strike a balance between compatability, as 61.9%* of devices run Android 11 or newer, and features provided through API level 30, such as systemwide Dark Mode, and a variety of new security features

#### When will the app release?

At the moment, Fletchapp is a concept, and so should be treated like any other vapourware product. I (the developer), make no guarentee that this product will release to the public.

## Challenges to Come

Ultimately I am using the project as a means to learn new skills as a student. As such, I am unsure if I will be able to attain the knowledge needed to create this app.

Some of the skills I still need to learn include:

- Labeling and pre-processing images for a dataset.
- Training a custom image segmentation model using Tensorflow.
- Creating a Material You themed Android app.
- Creating an intuitive user experiance.
- Marketing and releasing a product.

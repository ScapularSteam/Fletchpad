# What is Fletchapp?

When complete, Fletchapp will become an archery scoring app, intergrated with a custom Tensorflow Lite Object Recognition Model, ***and yes, I know that is a mouthful.*** It is being created as a passion project and a chance for me to learn new techniques and Android Development.

# What Platforms will Fletchpad work on?

- Android (Confirmed)
- IOS (Unknown)*

*As of now, Fletchapp is only intended for the Android audiance, and will be built to the Material3 guidelines. This being said, TensorFlow Lite models can be run on IOS, so the Arrow recogntion model could be ported, however I do not own an Apple Device for testing, so this may be rather difficult as of now.
